## Welcome to 16DaysofStatisticsCourse

# Day 01
We cover the following topics in Day 01:
* Introduction to descriptive statistics and Inferencial statistics
* Sample vs. Population
* Measures of Central Tendency
* Sample vs. Population Mean

**Statistics**:
* Statistics is the science that deals with methodologies to gather, review, analyze and draw conclusions from data. 
* With specific Statistics tools in hand we can derive many key observations and make predictions from the data in hand.

# Types of Statistics
1. **Descriptive Statistics:**
* Descriptive Statistics deals with numbers (numerical facts, figures, or information) to describe any phenomena.
* Examples are : Reports of industry production, cricket batting averages, government deficits, Movie Ratings etc. 

2. **Inferential statistics:**
* Inferential statistics deals with a decision, estimate, prediction, or generalization about apopulation, based on sample.Here we apply some mathematical formula on descriptive data to get inferences from the data.
*  Inferential statistics is used to make inferences from data whereas descriptive statistics simply describes whatâ€™s going on in  data. 

# Population
*  A population is a collection of all possible individual, objects, or measurements of interest. 
# Sample
* A sample is a portion, or part, of the population of interest.

# Measures of Central Tendency
* A measure of central tendency is a summary statistic that represents the center point or typical value of a dataset.
* These measures indicate where most values in a distribution fall and are also referred to as the central location of a distribution.
* We can think of it as the tendency of data to cluster around a middle value.
* In statistics,there are three most common measures of central tendency:
1. mean, 
2. median, 
3. mode
* Each of these measures calculates the location of the central point using a different method.

1. **Mean**
* The mean is the arithmetic average, for calculating the mean just add up all of the values and divide by the number of observations in  dataset.
Let us consider we  have dataset with n values as follows:

Mean for the above data will be given as:
